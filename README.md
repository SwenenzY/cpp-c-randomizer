# c - cpp Randomizer
Thank you for your interest in my project :)
### Why this project?
I am a cheat developer, I work on things like reverse engineering. I offer a good service with very advanced systems. I noticed that Anti-Cheats can detect some properties like ProjectGuid, void names, SolutionGuid. As I said, I already have advanced systems, and I use the auto build system for the products. With this project, they can stay undetected more.

# New Features!
 - Vcxproject Solution Guid Randomizer
 - Solution File Guid Randomizer
 
Soon;
- Randomize variables, voids, vectors, obfuscate.

### How can i use?
In this [line](https://github.com/SwenenzY/cpp-c-randomizer/blob/95fc42b589263540c4dbeb16345a015ff5488e68/Source/main.cpp#L52) you can edit file path, make sure it ends with // at the end. Also you can see settings in file you can change settings.
